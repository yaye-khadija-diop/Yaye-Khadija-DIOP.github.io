  <!-- ===== About Section ===== -->
  <section class="section" id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Master’s student in Data Science and Business Analytics, specializing in Data Engineering, 
      with a strong background in mathematics. I am naturally curious and thrive on challenges, enjoying 
      the process of analyzing complex problems and learning new technologies. My current studies have 
      strengthened my interest in machine learning, deep learning, and cloud computing (AWS), while I also 
      possess solid skills in data management and big data.

      Through my coursework, I have gained hands-on experience with Hadoop, Spark, Hive, and HBase for distributed 
      data processing, as well as advanced techniques in data warehousing, ETL, and governance. My specialization in
      Data Engineering has also exposed me to data protection and management strategies, including backup, replication, 
      deduplication, and fault-tolerant architectures, ensuring secure and resilient data systems.

      I am passionate about turning complex datasets into actionable insights and building scalable, secure, and efficient 
      data pipelines. My goal is to leverage my expertise in big data technologies, cloud infrastructure, and machine learning
      to design solutions that drive innovation and support data-driven decision making in real-world contexts.
